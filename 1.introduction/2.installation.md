# Installation

JOII can be used in a browser or as a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) module.

## Browser

Download the latest release of JOII on the [github page](https://github.com/haroldiedema/joii)
and load it like any other JavaScript library. No further actions are needed.

```markup
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/joii.min.js"></script>
```

> JOII is compatible with all browsers starting from Internet Explorer 5.5 and
> does not require any dependencies.

## Node

```javascript
var JOII = require("joii");

var MyClass = JOII.Class({ /* ... */ });
```

Since version 4, JOII no longer exposes itself to the global scope by default.
If you wish to enable the function `Class`, `Interface` and `Enum` to the global scope,
use the `useGlobal()` function when requiring JOII.

```javascript
require("joii").useGlobal();

var MyClass = Class({ /* ... */ });
````
Note that this isn't needed when running in a browser.


## Development & Testing

Clone the repository from the [github page](https://github.com/haroldiedema/joii).

Make sure npm and node are installed.

Install dependencies and run the testsuite (configurable in `testsuite.js`)
```javascript
~ npm install
~ npm test
```

Use `testsuite.html` for browser testing. Both NodeJS and the browser testsuite
use the same configuration for testing.
