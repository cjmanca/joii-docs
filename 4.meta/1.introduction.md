# Introduction

When we speak of metadata, what we're really talking about is configuration of
a class or a member of a class. Think of visibility, whether an implementation
is final, abstract, immutable or even nullable. Metadata can be applied to
class members by declaring them as a *string*.

Properties will have getter- and setter methods generated automatically if they
are declared *public* or *protected*. The setter automatically checks if the
type of the passed argument matches the type of the property as it is defined
in the declaration.

For example:

```javascript
var MyClass = Class({
    // visibility
    // |     flags
    // |       |     type
    // |       |       |    name
    // |       |       |     |
    'public nullable string name': null
});

var my_class = new MyClass();

// Set the 'name' property to "Bob".
my_class.setName('Bob');

// Reset it to null.
my_class.setName(null);

// Throws exception: "setName expects string, number given."
my_class.setName(123);
```

> The order in which visibility, flags and types are defined does not matter
> as long as the *name* of the property always comes last.
